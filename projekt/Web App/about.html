                    The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena shared with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association, and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League. The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 17 NBA championships, tied with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history.  
                    The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL). The new team began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers. Initially a member of the NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they would win five of the next six championships, led by star George Mikan. After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960-61 season.

                    During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.
                    The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor.
                    In the 1960 NBA draft, the team selected Jerry West. Elgin Baylor and Jerry West led the team to a total of ten NBA Finals appearances in the 1960s and 1970s.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 25px;"> Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title—and first in Los Angeles—in 1972, led by new head coach Bill Sharman.
                    The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points, and had a 3-2 lead after five. Boston won the series in seven games however, and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.

                <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 80px;">After missing the playoffs in the 1974-75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time. In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick. It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his "no-look" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense. The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.</p>

            <div class="section5">
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.
                    With this duo, the Lakers went on to win the 2000 Finals against the Indiana Pacers, the 2001 Finals againt the Philadelphia 76ers and the 2002 Finals against the New Jersey Nets. They achieved the famous three-peat, O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.

                <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left: 25px;">In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies. Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award. They made their way to the Finals but lost to the Celtics.
                    But in the 2008-09 season, they made their way back to the Finals, and won against the Orlando Magic. Kobe Bryant got his first Finals MVP.
                    The next year they made the Finals again, against the Celtics, but this time winning it all in 7 games. Kobe wins his second Finals MVP and 5th ring in total.

                <p style="font-size: 25px;">On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.
                    They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010. They defeated the Miami Heat 4-2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals, and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career. 
                    The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.</p>
